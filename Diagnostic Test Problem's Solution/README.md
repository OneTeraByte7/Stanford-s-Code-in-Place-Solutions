<h2>Overview</h2>

After completing 6 weeks Lectures + Modules, it was now time for testing our in depth knowledge of what all we learned and grasped throught the course.
Diagnostic Test was initially restricted to 50 mins but later was increased to 120 mins.
The problems put forth were of a good level , inorder to check basic concepts of Loops ,Array, Lists, Tuple and what not !
I was able to solve 4/5 Question, as i didn't gave priority to 5th question being of graphics but solved rest 4 problem related to core programming
A Normal programmer with clear concepts would somewhere take around take 15-30 mins to solve it  

Enjoyed the test !!
