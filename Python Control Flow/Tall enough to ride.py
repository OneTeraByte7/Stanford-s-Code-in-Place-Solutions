"""Question : Write a program which asks the user how tall they are and prints whether or not they're taller than a pre-specified minimum height.
              In amusement parks (ah, the good old pre-pandemic days...), rollercoasters frequently have minimum height requirements for safety 
              reasons. Assume for now that the minimum height is 50 of whatever height unit you'd like :)
